        <h4 class="text-primary"> BUGSS provides creative learning experiences, responsive to the interests of our community members. </h4>
        <p class="pb-3">Neiyer Correal-Winters and his two sons Naige and Patrick read about groundbreaking CRISPR technology that allows rapid and efficient genome editing. Eager to try their hands with the technology, they obtained a family
          membership to BUGSS, ordered materials online, and developed their own CRISPR project under the guidance of lab staff and mentors. At the BUGSS lab, they are able to pursue this unique family activity!</p>
        <h4 class="text-primary"> BUGSS motivates students with socially relevant science. </h4>
        <p class="pb-3">Ella Coleman is a home schooled student who joined the BUGSS team for the International Genetically Engineered Machines competition (iGEM). The six high school students conceived of a project, engineering bacterial cells to
          degrade plastic and help clean up pollution in the Inner Harbor. Ella traveled to Boston with the team, delivered oral and poster presentations at the International Jamboree of high school and college students, talked about her work with
          faculty judges, and won a team bronze medal. The team’s incredible work was recognized with an article and video of Ella on the front page of the Baltimore Sun!</p>
        <h4 class="text-primary"> BUGSS inspires science and technology careers. </h4>
        <p class="pb-3">Rachael Avidor, Julius Gingles, and Mercedes Thompson are three students from Baltimore city high schools who participated in BUGSS’ 2016 iGEM team. While these three students had long been interested in science, the iGEM
          experience was unique in allowing them to take leadership and ownership of a scientific project. Each is continuing to excel on their scientific path, engaging in additional research at Johns Hopkins and the NIH, winning full scholarships
          to Brown and Johns Hopkins Universities, and founding Baltimore Beyond Plastic. These students will lead the scientific revolution of the next generation!</p>

              Do you know any students that would be interested in hands-on learning in the lab by building with biology in the summer?
            </h3>
            <p>The International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) competition is an annual event open to undergraduate teams, high school students, and community labs like BUGSS from around the world. Explore the iGEM website:
              http://igem.org/About
            </p>
            <p>

              It’s kind of a big deal, with teams working all year to make their own genetic machines from existing and novel parts. Examples include a rainbow of pigmented bacteria, banana and wintergreen smelling bacteria, and an arsenic sensor.
              Know any
              wiz kids who love science? This is a great opportunity to let their creativity flow and build a genetic device of their own design.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the past two years, the BUGSS (Baltimore Underground Science Space) community lab has hosted a team of high school students who participated in iGEM-they are the Baltimore BioCrew! Their project was to engineer bacteria to break
              down
              plastic that contaminates the inner harbor. Check out a front page story on the Baltimore Sun here: http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-plastic-eating-bacteria-20161116-story.html
            </p>
            <p>
              This year, the BioCrew mentored middle school students who were associate members and worked on a related project on plastic degradation. The team is looking for more middle school associate members and high school members to join the
              team!
              The team will meet throughout the winter and spring on Saturdays to prepare for their summer working in the lab. This is a unique opportunity for students to participate in creative hands-on science!

                Hello, we are the Baltimore Bio Crew and we are a team of high school students. We work at the Baltimore Underground Science Space (BUGSS). BUGSS is a public laboratory offering classes, seminars, and lab access so that anyone can
                safely
                and affordably investigate the living world.
              </p>
              <p>
                We successfully showcased “Coagulance Rx” at the 2018 iGEM Giant Jamboree, the synthetic biology industry’s largest innovation event hosted by the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Foundation. The Giant Jamboree
                is
                the
                culminating event of iGEM’s annual, worldwide, synthetic biology competition for students all around the world to use genetic engineering to solve local problems.

          <h3>
            We’re thrilled that our team won a bronze medal and also the award for Best High School Presentation!
          </h3>
          <p>
            Each year, the competition brings together more than 6,000 participants from across the globe to explore and create unique applications of synthetic biology with the mission to bring positive contributions to their communities and
            society at large. Beyond the technology, participants are evaluated on teamwork, responsibility, entrepreneurship, sharing, safety and more. Baltimore Underground Science Space (BUGSS), Baltimore’s regional community laboratory,
            sponsors a team each year, the Baltimore BioCrew, which brings together students from Baltimore and our neighboring communities to combat a local problem using synthetic biology. “The Baltimore BioCrew program is a true collaborative
            project,” says Lisa Scheifele Ph.D., Executive Director of BUGSS. “It brings our students together with professional scientists and trainees who serve as their scientific mentors, local professionals such as the Chesapeake Area
            Biological Safety Association and the University of Maryland’s Science, Technology and Society program who mentor our students on safety and presentation skills, and individual and corporate sponsors such as Becton Dickinson, Inc. who
            partner with us to support this amazing team.”
          </p>

          <p>
            The Baltimore BioCrew’s team’s project, Coagulance Rx, originated from the team’s desire to address gun violence in Baltimore. When meeting with Dr. Thomas Scalea, Physician-in-Chief at the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center
            and
            Dr. Habeeba Park of Stop the Bleed, they learned that massive blood loss can cause death within only 5-10 minutes. Rallied to action by stories of preventable deaths during incidents like the Sandy Hook massacre, the BioCrew used
            synthetic biology to engineer bacterial cells that would produce the Russel’s viper snake venom protein. This protein coagulates blood and can be embedded in bandages that are distributed to the public to help stop bleeding in
            emergency
            situations. BioCrew team member Henry Ryle found that, “iGEM was an incredible experience. I learned so much about myself and the synthetic biology field, a field of study that I barely knew existed. I learned graduate level
            scientific
            procedures as a high schooler, and learned how to program a website. It has totally changed my view of the world- seeing other teams and listening to their work in Boston was eye opening to me. I am so glad I got this opportunity, and
            I
            hope other high schoolers in Baltimore get it as well.”

              biology. Many of the projects presented at iGEM will serve as the foundation and inspiration for important research, influential companies and international interest to come – these participants are most certainly tomorrow’s
