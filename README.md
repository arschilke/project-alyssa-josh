Not Yet Implemented Features -- list the features that are planned but not yet implemented.

Dependencies -- what software, libraries, databases, operating systems, etc, are required for compiling and/or running your code? How does one install these dependencies (can be provided via link to instruction page)?

Instructions for Compilation -- exactly what does one need to do to compile your code? Include all steps and assumptions EXACTLY.
